/**You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array. Find the smallest number in the smallest positive number and largest positive number. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 Explanation: In the given array, Smallest positive number = 1 Largest positive number = 5 So, Smallest positive missing number = 6

Input Format

First line consists the size of an array. Second line consists the elements of an array.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 106 -106 <= arr[i] <= 106

Output Format

Output contain the smallest positive number missing from the array.
