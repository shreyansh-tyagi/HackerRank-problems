A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. Given an integer, , rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

Example


After  rotations, .

rotateLeft has the following parameters:

int d: the amount to rotate by
int arr[n]: the array to rotate
Returns

int[n]: the rotated array
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote , the number of integers, and , the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .

Constraints

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

To perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:



n,d = (int(x) for x in input().split())
l = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
length = len(l)
new = [0 for x in l]
for i in range(length):
    o = i-d
    new[o]=str(l[i])
print(" ".join(new))
