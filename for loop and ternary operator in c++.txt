A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
A sample loop is

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

Input Format

You will be given two positive integers,  and  (), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer  in the inclusive interval :

If , then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for , and so on.
Else if  and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if  and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
Note: 

Sample Input

8
11
Sample Output

eight
nine
even
odd



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()

    int a,b;
    string c[]={"","one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine"};
    cin>>a>>b;
    for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
        cout<<((i<=9)?c[i]:((i%2==0)?"even":"odd"))<<endl;
