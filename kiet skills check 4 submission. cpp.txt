Vishal has recently started solving problems on hackerrank. Since he is a noob in problem solving he wants continuous growth in number of problems solved per day. He started with 'a' problems on first day.

He solves 'd' problems more than previous day. But after every 'k' days , he increases 'd' by 'inc' .

Can you guess how many questions he will solve on nth day ?

Input Format

First line contains T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. Each testcase contains of a single line of input,five integers a,d,k,n,inc

Constraints

1≤T≤15

1≤a≤99

1≤d≤100

1≤n≤10000

1≤k≤n

0≤inc≤99

Output Format

For each testcase, output in a single line number of questions solved on nth day.

Sample Input 0

1
1 4 3 8 2
Sample Output 0

43
