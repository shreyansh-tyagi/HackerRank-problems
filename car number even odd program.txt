/**KIET Group of Institutions administration applied the odd-even rule on the basis of the sum of the last two digits of the registered number. Now administration wants a program to check that the car is allowed on that particular day or not.

In this you need to take last 2 digit number from user and todya's date (only dd). If there is a match like even - even then show "Yes" else "No".

*If last two digit sum is 0 then consider it as even *For any invalid input print "Invalid input"

Input Format

    First line will contain the last two digits of the CAR Number.
    Second line will contain Today's date(DD) Format.

Constraints

    Car number can't be more than 99.
    Date can't be more than 31.
    None of these can be negative.

Output Format

One line output saying only one of these "YES" or "NO" or "INVALID INPUT"

Sample Input 0

33
12

Sample Output 0

YES

Explanation 0

Sum of both the digit of CAR Number 33 is even(3+3=6) and 12 (Date) is also even so YES **/



a=input('enter last two digit of car number: ')
b=input('enter the date: ')
if(int(a)<100) and (int(b)<31):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        d=int(a[i])+int(a[i+1])
        if(d==0):
            print('INVALID INPUT')
            break
        #print(d)
        break       
    if(d%2==0) and (int(b)%2==0) and (d!=0):
        print('YES')
    elif(d!=0):
        print('NO')
