Task
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is . If there is  child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly  children will have at least  boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. Then print your result, rounded to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).

Input Format

A single line containing the following values:

1.09 1
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Output Format

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
