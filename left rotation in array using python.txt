A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. Given an integer, , rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

Example


After  rotations, .

rotateLeft has the following parameters:

int d: the amount to rotate by
int arr[n]: the array to rotate
Returns

int[n]: the rotated array
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote , the number of integers, and , the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .

Constraints

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

To perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

[1,2,3,4,5]->     [2,3,4,5,1]->[3,4,5,1,2]->[4,5,1,2,3]->[5,1,2,3,4]


n,b=map(int,input().split())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))[:n]
for i in range(b):
   for j in range(n-1):
    temp=a[j]
    a[j]=a[j+1]
    a[j+1]=temp
for i in range(n):
    print(a[i],end=' ')
