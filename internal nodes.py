'''
Internal nodes are those nodes of tree that have atleast one child and the node with no child called as leaf. N-ary tree is a tree in which a node can have maximum of n-child.

We have a n-ary tree with X internal nodes. Find the maximum number of leaf nodes present in that tree.

Ex- Binary tree with 3 internal nodes can have maximum of 4 leaf nodes. Similarly ternary(3-ary) with 5 internal nodes can have maximum of 11 leaf nodes. Generalise the concept and find out the the number of leaf nodes for various n-ary tree with different internal nodes.

Input Format
