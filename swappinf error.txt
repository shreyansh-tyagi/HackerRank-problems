'''
Ritu got marks M1 & M2 in Chemistery & Physics respectively. But the marks M1 & M2 gets interchanged during the process of uploading marks. To avoid this we create a progrmam that swaps the two numbers to compensate the error without using third varible. But, the program has an error that the (-) sign & (+) sign get interchanged in swapping program.

Assume that the original sum of M1 & M2 is S1 and the sum after applying modified swap procedure is S2, then find the the number maximum among S1 & S2.

Input Format

Accept to numbers M1 & M2.

Constraints

0 <= M1 <= 100 0 <= M2 <= 100

Output Format

Print the sum of modified number M1 & M2 and also find maximum among S1 & S2, Sum = M1 + M2 Max = max(M1, M2)

Sample Input 0

5  15
Sample Output 0

Sum = 0
Max = 20
