Aryan loves Computer Network and he wants to learn about the implementation of Go Back-N protocol. He took a set of integer and a variable ‘k’ and decided to find the maximum possible sum of ‘k’ consecutive elements from the set of integers.

Input Format

Given the value of ‘k’ , ‘n’ and an array of size ‘n’ as input in 3 separate lines

Constraints

1<= k <= 20 1<= n <= 20

Output Format

Print the maximum obtained sum

k=int(input())
n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))[:n]

groups = (a[pos:pos + k] for pos in range(0, len(a), 1)) 
highest_value = 0 
for group in groups:
    if len(group) == k and sum(group) > highest_value:
        highest_value = sum(group)
print(highest_value)
